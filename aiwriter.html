<p> William Li and Jordan Poole were high school sweethearts who fell in love at first sight. They were inseparable, and everyone who knew them could see that they were meant to be together. As they entered adulthood, they got married and started a family of their own.
Throughout their marriage, William and Jordan remained loyal to each other, always putting their family first. When William's job required him to work long hours, Jordan supported him and managed the household and their children. When Jordan's mother fell ill, William was there to offer emotional support and help with medical bills.
Their love for each other and their family never wavered, even during the toughest times. When their son was diagnosed with a rare disease, they both put their careers on hold to care for him and make sure he received the best medical care possible.
Their loyalty extended beyond their immediate family as well. They were always there to help their extended family and friends, offering a listening ear, a kind word, or a helping hand whenever needed.</p>
