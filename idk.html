<p>I like sleeping and listening to music when i have time. I also like to travel or play baskteball or stuff. There all make me feel happy.&nbsp; &nbsp;Every time when we play games with other school, I like to feel the nervous feelings and this will make me feel exciting. I also like music because everytime when I feel pressure or struggle, the music will make me feel less pressure and relax. It also make me feel relax.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes I also like&nbsp; to spend more time with myself to make me feel also relax. I like enjoy the time when I was in the beach. I like heard the sound of the water and the wind beside the sea. I like to travel to other country to get another understanding of the world instead of China. I visit the US three times and each time I got different feelings of the country. I undertsand the country more deeply and get more and more interesting of the country.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
