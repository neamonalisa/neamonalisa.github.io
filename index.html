<p>I was born in 2009, and i am 14 years old&nbsp; right now.&nbsp; My primay school was in a not famous school near my house. I transfer to BASIS when I was in the first year of middle school. Now I love my life in BASIS and I enjoy this school. we have many classes and we have GPA for each section of the school year. This give us lots of pressure and we enjoy the happy pressure of the happy school. All the students in this school are interesting especially some of the boys in Grade eight. They like to laugh and make jokes of other and their friedns. They are acting like three years old kid when they are in front of their classmates and change very quick when the teacher of Deans come. They are funny like the clowns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
